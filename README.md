## **Business Problem:**

- Using a API, I extracted Yelp data and merged it with health inspections data from city-wide inspections by the department of health in New York City for Pizza Resturants in Brooklyn.
- By employing hypothesis testing, I investigated the corelations between elevated inspection scores and the likelihood of restaurants in Brooklyn garnering enhanced reviews on Yelp.
- I used multiple modeling techniques to represent the various aspects of my findings for Brooklyn Pizza Restaurants.
